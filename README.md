This code is written from scratch  converting a repo written in Kotlin .See the original code here (https://github.com/heyletscode/android-video-call-app).From this code ,I wrote its equivalent in Java.This original repo used firebase for some exchanging  call key between peers.But I  decided to use Socket Io instead.
